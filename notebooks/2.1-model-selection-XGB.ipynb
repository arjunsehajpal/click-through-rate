    "With the aggregation of data behind us, we still need to work on the data in order to feed the data to the Machine Learning model, so it can train on the data in the best way possible. One transformation that is required is the **Scaling** of the data, as most algorithms, like Deep Neural Nets, works considerably better when fed with scaled data. Other Machine Learning models like XGBoost are immune to scaling. So, scaling has no effect on XGBoost. \n",
    "\n",
    "Only continuous columns go through scaling. For categorical columns, we face other challenges. Foremost of these challenges is the high cardinality. For instance, the `app_code` column has 477 different values, which gives a very high cardinality to that particular column. To deal with this, we will use **Weight of Evidence**. In the weight of evidence algorithm, total number of records with the positive and negative class labels are also taken into account. For class imbalanced data, this algorithm works better. The advantages of using Weight of evidence are:-\n",
    "- Handles missing values\n",
    "- Handles outliers\n",
    "- The transformation is based on logarithmic value of distributions. This is aligned with the logistic regression output function\n",
